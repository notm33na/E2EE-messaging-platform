# Fixing Certificate Security Warning

## Current Status
✅ mkcert is installed  
✅ vite-plugin-mkcert is configured with your IP address (192.168.56.1)  
⚠️ You may need to install the mkcert CA certificate

## Step 1: Install the mkcert CA Certificate

The mkcert CA certificate must be installed on your system for browsers to trust certificates generated by mkcert.

**Run this command in PowerShell as Administrator:**

```powershell
mkcert -install
```

This will:
- Create a local Certificate Authority (CA)
- Install it in your system's trust store
- Allow browsers to trust certificates generated by mkcert

## Step 2: Restart Your Dev Server

After installing the CA, restart your Vite dev server:

```powershell
cd client
npm run dev
```

The plugin will now generate a certificate that includes:
- `localhost`
- `127.0.0.1`
- `192.168.56.1` (your local IP)

## Step 3: Clear Browser Cache (if needed)

If you still see warnings after the above steps:

1. **Chrome/Edge:**
   - Go to `chrome://settings/clearBrowserData`
   - Select "Cached images and files"
   - Clear data
   - Restart browser

2. **Firefox:**
   - Go to `about:preferences#privacy`
   - Click "Clear Data"
   - Select "Cached Web Content"
   - Clear

## Verification

After completing the steps above, when you visit `https://192.168.56.1:5173`, you should see:
- ✅ A padlock icon in the address bar
- ✅ No security warnings
- ✅ "Connection is secure" message

## Troubleshooting

### Still seeing warnings?

1. **Verify CA is installed:**
   ```powershell
   mkcert -CAROOT
   ```
   This should show a path. If it doesn't, run `mkcert -install` again.

2. **Check certificate details:**
   - Click the padlock icon in your browser
   - View certificate details
   - Verify it shows "Issued by: mkcert [your name]"

3. **Try accessing via localhost:**
   - Try `https://localhost:5173` first
   - If that works, the issue is specific to the IP address

4. **Regenerate certificate:**
   - Delete the `.vite` folder in the client directory
   - Restart the dev server to regenerate the certificate

### Alternative: Manual Certificate Generation

If the plugin doesn't work, you can manually generate a certificate:

```powershell
cd client
mkcert localhost 127.0.0.1 192.168.56.1
```

This creates:
- `localhost+2.pem` (certificate)
- `localhost+2-key.pem` (private key)

Then update `vite.config.js` to use these files directly.
